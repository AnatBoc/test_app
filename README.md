There are just a few requirements in the task, but seems like you have lots of checks to validate code quality, or etc. Architecture, codeStype etc could be done in a various vays, depends on futur purposes. For this task i did it  just simple with a structure which is more complex than its needed for this task, but in case there will be needed more pages, it will be usefull to add them. 
As for state manager, for this task its more than enough to use stateless widget, but for bigger projects cubit is more preferable to make it scalable and readable. 
Animations is  not provided as a requirements, so there are no of them.
I used GH workflow from your repository, is it was suggested
This app was tested on Web, iOS, Android platforms

in case of any requirements changes, or code clarifications, please contact tolyabocyura@gmail.com
